//! Chemharp is a multi-language library written in modern C++ for reading and
//! writing from and to molecular trajectory files. These files are created by
//! your favorite theoretical chemistry program, and contains informations about
//! atomic or residues names and positions. Some format also have additional
//! informations, such as velocities, forces, energy, â€¦
//!
//! This crate expose the C API of chemharp to Rust, and make all the
//! functionalities accessibles. For more informations on the C++ library,
//! please see its [documentation](http://chemharp.rtfd.org). Specifically, the
//! following pages are worth reading:
//!
//! - The [overview](http://chemharp.rtfd.org/en/latest/overview.html) of the
//!   classes organisation;
//! - The [supported formats](http://chemharp.rtfd.org/en/latest/formats.html);
//!
//!
//! As all the function call the underlying C library, they all can fail and
//! thus all return a `Result<_, Error>` value.
