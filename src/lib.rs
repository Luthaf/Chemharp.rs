//! Chemfiles is a multi-language library written in modern C++ for reading and
//! writing from and to molecular trajectory files. These files are created by
//! your favorite theoretical chemistry program, and contains informations about
//! atomic or residues names and positions. Some format also have additional
//! informations, such as velocities, forces, energy, â€¦
//!
//! This crate expose the C API of chemfiles to Rust, and make all the
//! functionalities accessibles. For more informations on the C++ library,
//! please see its [documentation][cxx_doc]. Specifically, the following pages
//! are worth reading:
//!
//! - The [overview][overview] of the classes organisation;
//! - The lisf of [supported formats][formats];
//! - The documentation for the [selection language][selections];
//!
//! As all the function call the underlying C library, they all can fail and
//! thus all return a `Result<_, Error>` value.
